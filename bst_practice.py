# Problems:
# (1) Insert items with the following keys (in the given order) into 
# an initially empty binary search tree:  
# 30 ,  40 ,  24 ,  58 ,  48 ,  26 ,  11 ,  13 . 
# Draw the tree after any two insertions.

# (2) The height of a node v in a rooted tree T is defined as the 
# number of edges on the longest simple downwards path from the node v 
# to a leaf. Write an algorithm that calculates the height of all nodes 
# in a binary tree and has running time O(n).
